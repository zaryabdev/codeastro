We thought it would be fun to make a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) theme with our brand colors as part of getting the word out there about Agathist. You can download the extension either through the "Extensions" tab in the VSCode editor, or on the VSCode Marketplace, by searching for "Agathist Themes".

Currently, only "Agathist Dark" is available, but a light theme will come in the near future.

If you enjoy the theme, feel free to give it some stars on the VSCode Marketplace and on Github.

If you find issues with the theme, please submit them to the [Github repo](https://github.com/agathist/vscode-themes). We'll do what we can to make improvements.
