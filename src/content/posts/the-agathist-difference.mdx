In a recent meeting with another software agency owner, I was advised to try and hone in on what makes Agathist different. I was told to analyze our successful client projects and try and figure out what themes come from them. Here are a few:

### No hand-holding necessary

Our clients hired us because we are React experts. In each case, our clients needed someone who could do React work without any hand-holding whatsoever. So long as we have the requisite info we need to do the job, we can do it start-to-finish with minimal input from the client. We remove the stress of knowing your app is getting built correctly, so you can focus on other important matters.

### React and React Native skills

This might be simply coincidence, but so far, all our client projects have involved building features on both platforms, often simultaneously. While both React and React Native share the same React core, there are important differences between the platforms when it comes to building user interfaces. Our experience and expertise enables us to navigate these differences for our clients, knowing where we can share functionality, and where it's wisest to build separate implementations. If you have a project spanning both platforms, we're the agency that can help you out.

### Speed

Simply put, we build fast. Our expertise enables us not to lose time going down the wrong paths. We've been there before, we know the way to go. We don't fall down the rabbit holes other devs might. We know when to make the right tradeoffs to keep the project moving forward. And we know how to start projects with a solid foundations so our velocity remains high as the project progresses. So far, every client has been impressed with speed. To us, it's justification for why we charge so much. You can find cheaper agencies, but will they deliver as quickly and as solidly as we will.

### Takeaway

If you need React or React Native work done quickly and correctly, by people you can trust to do it right, then we're the agency you should get in contact with.
