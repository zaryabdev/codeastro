While we love working with a variety of databases, all other things being equal, we'll reach for PostgreSQL every time. It's relational, it's flexible, and has tons of community.

We like to pair PostgreSQL with ORMs like [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to build out full stack applications.
