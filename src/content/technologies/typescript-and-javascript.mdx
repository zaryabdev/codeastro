TypeScript and JavaScript are the foundation of everything we do at Agathist. JavaScript is one of the world's most popular programming languages and TypeScript makes working with it in teams and large codebases just that much sweeter.

When we build you a new application, or help you refactor an existing one, we leverage TypeScript to ensure code quality and correctness. It doesn't hurt that it genuinely speeds up your development process through smart code autocompletion, and catching bugs and errors before your users do.
