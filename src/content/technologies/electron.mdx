Electron is a framework that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It combines Node.js for backend functionality with Chromium for rendering the frontend, enabling the creation of desktop apps that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase. Popular apps like VS Code and Slack are built using Electron.

The key benefits of Electron include rapid development and the ability to reuse web development skills for desktop app creation. Since it uses a single codebase across platforms, it simplifies maintenance and reduces development costs. Additionally, Electron provides access to native system APIs, allowing developers to create powerful desktop apps with features like file system access, notifications, and more.
