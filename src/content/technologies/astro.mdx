Astro is a rising technology that we're betting on. It is, quite simply, the best framework for developing websites with "islands architecture", that is, primarily shipping HTML and CSS and only sprinkling in the JavaScript you need, where you need it. It is incredibly fast and lightweight, and we expect big things to come from the framework.

We're excited to transform your content sites from something old and crufty to something great with Astro. This very site is built with Astro, and you're more than welcome to check out the source code at [https://github.com/agathist/website](https://github.com/agathist/website) to get a feel for it.
