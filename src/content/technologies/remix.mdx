Remix is a full-stack web framework that focuses on improving the performance and user experience of modern applications. It emphasizes server-side rendering (SSR), enabling faster page loads and better SEO by delivering pre-rendered HTML to the client. Remix also integrates deeply with web fundamentals like HTTP caching and progressive enhancement, ensuring apps work efficiently on various network conditions.

One of the key benefits of Remix is its optimized data loading and form handling. It reduces client-side JavaScript by letting developers manage data requests directly on the server. This improves app performance, especially in complex UIs. Additionally, Remix has built-in error handling and supports nested routing, allowing for modular, maintainable code structures.
