MongoDB is a NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility, using a document-oriented data model. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, making it ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. Itâ€™s schema-less, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures, which is especially useful in agile development environments where requirements change frequently.

The key benefits of MongoDB include high scalability and ease of use. Its ability to handle large volumes of data and distribute it across multiple servers ensures performance even as data grows. Additionally, MongoDB's flexible schema allows developers to iterate quickly, adapting data models as needed without downtime or complex migrations, making it a great fit for modern web applications.
