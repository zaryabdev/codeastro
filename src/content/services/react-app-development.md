Building applications with React is the core of our business. Why? Because we're _really_ good at it.

React is a trusted technology for building web and mobile applications and we literally have decades of combined experience using it. Kyle has been building applications with React for over 10 years already, starting in 2014. There's a high likelihood you've read some of his writing on the topic and it might even be why you're here seeking his expertise.

If you're a company or a founder with a new application to build, you can trust Kyle and the rest of the team at Codeastro to do the job right.
